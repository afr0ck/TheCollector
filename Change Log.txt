Update 9 Nov 2020
+ All monster objects added
	+ Damage variables added for varied monster damage
	+ Monster show health bars after hit for brief moment
		+ Damage offset was set to account for using Instance Health of 100
		+ I.E Slime HP = 20. Damage offset is (100/20) * 10
			- This means the player jump does 10 damage to the monster which has 20 HP but on a scale from 0-100 so Instance Health works
	+ Mushrooms squish breifly upon getting stepped on
+ Cleaned up some messy looking code
	+ Added comments for anything a little more involved

- TODO
	- Finish all levels
		- To include new monster objects added
	- Win screen
	---- OPTIONALS ----
	- Flight paths for flying monsters
	- Breakable vase for extra health / lives
